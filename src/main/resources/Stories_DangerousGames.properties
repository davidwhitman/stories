## Part 1: Dragons ##
#### Stage 1: Bar Event ####
dg_dr_stg1_prompt=The moment you pass through the bar door, a strong drink is pressed into your hand. You look at it, dumbfounded, and then look up to the waiter who gave it to you. "Compliments of Mr. Karengo," he says, nodding his head towards a crowd of people, mostly young men, before moving on.
dg_dr_stg1_startBarEvent=Head over to "Mr. Karengo"
dg_dr_stg1_pg1_onShown=As you make your way over, you note that nearly everyone in the bar has the same drink you do. In the middle of the crowd, a large, heavily muscled, and tattooed man is gesticulating wildly, apparently telling a story.
dg_dr_stg1_pg1_opt1=Go listen to the man
dg_dr_stg1_pg1_opt2=Leave
dg_dr_stg1_pg2_para1="...so then he asks me, have you ever ridden one? And I look back at this crazy joithead and I say, you're a crazy joithead. But he's got me thinking, y'know? Nobody has ever ridden one. Least, not nobody that could talk after." He lets out a sharp laugh, then raises his voice. "So I ask you all; who wants to join Karengo to make history? Who wants to ride a dragon?"
dg_dr_stg1_pg2_para2=You've heard the stories of the dragons flying through ==${dragonPlanet}'s== skies as a child. Great beasts; graceful and dangerous, the apex predators of the air, they are strikingly similar to the dragons described in ancient legends. The Persean Sector is host to many dangerous creatures, and these living myths hold a place near the top of that list.
dg_dr_stg1_pg2_para3=A cheer goes up from the men, especially the drunk ones. Karengo starts to hand out death and accident waivers and collect money for the expedition. Suddenly, his expression darkens as he cocks his head, listening to an earpiece. "Listen up!" he yells, "Seems my regular pilot got in the way of some less reputable folk, and my replacement pilot misplaced his balls this evening and can't find 'em! We need ourselves a ship and a captain to bring this lot to ==${dragonPlanet}==! Who's brave enough? Who else wants to make history?"
dg_dr_stg1_pg2_opt1="Captain ${playerLastName}, at your service. We leave at dawn!"
dg_dr_stg1_pg2_opt2=Stay silent
dg_dr_stg1_pg3_onShown=You wake up significantly after dawn with empty bottles and unconscious men strewn all over the ship's mess hall. Karengo peels himself off the floor and gives you a crooked smile, shielding his eyes from the light. "Alright, ${playerLastName}," he says, "let's do this."
dg_dr_stg1_pg3_opt1=Leave

dg_dr_intel_subtitle_stg2=Return the group back to ==${startPlanet}== in the ==${startSystem}==
dg_dr_intel_desc_para1=A lively man named Karengo and a few passionate youth are traveling with you to see the draconic animals on ==${dragonPlanet}== in the ==${dragonSystem}==.
dg_dr_intel_desc_stg2=Return to ==${startPlanet}== in the ==${startSystem}==.
dg_dr_intel_desc_stg3=The surviving men were returned home, having gotten more adventure than they bargained for.
dg_dr_intel_desc_stg-failedByAbandon=You abandoned the Dragonriders to their deaths on ${dragonPlanet}. They will never fly again.
#
#### Stage 2: Arrival at planet ####
dg_dr_stg2_pg1_para1=The men load into a shuttle and Karengo directs you down through the atmosphere of ${dragonPlanet}${ifColonized}. As you're putting down in a clearing halfway up a mountain, you hear an otherworldly screech and your ship lurches violently to one side. You would have been thrown to the floor if you hadn't been strapped in.
dg_dr_stg2_pg1_para1_ifColonized=, steering clear of the usual tourist areas and, you realize, of the local law enforcement
dg_dr_stg2_pg1_para2="Look lively, lads!" shouts Karengo, the only person still standing. "Your chariot awaits!" He double-checks the jetpacks on the backs of each of the men, or "Dragonriders", as they creatively branded themselves during their first night of the voyage, then opens the side hatch and hurls the Dragonriders out the door before jumping himself.
dg_dr_stg2_pg1_para3=After the group has left, you land - this time undisturbed - and pull up every external camera you have to watch the action.
dg_dr_stg2_pg1_opt1=Continue
dg_dr_stg2_pg2_para1=The dragons of ${dragonPlanet} you learned about on the "Xenofauna and Flora" channel were different from the dragons of mythology, but the beasts you see today aren't quite what you learned about, either. For one, the creatures flying outside your window are largely invisible - a trick of the way the light reflects around the scales on their hides. They are faster, too, or perhaps the ones on the show had been drugged to make them easier to film.
dg_dr_stg2_pg2_para2=A quick survey of the scene shows that Karengo has tagged three dragons with some sort of harmless marker gun to make them easier to track. Eight of the Dragonriders are chasing the largest one, which is missing part of a tooth and has blackened scales from where it hit your shuttle's shield. The last Dragonrider is nowhere in sight.
dg_dr_stg2_pg2_para3=Suddenly, proximity sensors go off on the starboard side and a camera shows something - or someone - bounce off your shield and tumble down the mountain.
dg_dr_stg2_pg2_opt1=Announce that you're leaving
dg_dr_stg2_pg2_opt2=Stay and watch the Dragonriders
dg_dr_stg2_pg2_opt3=Take off, leaving everybody else behind (leave)
dg_dr_stg2_pg3_para1=Checking your camera feeds again, you see that object rolling down the hill is indeed a body. On another monitor, one of the Dragonriders is keeping just above a dragon, attempting to lower himself down. The dragon rolls in midair, its wing catching the man and sending him flying out of control. Fortunately, a leafy tree branch prevents any further physical harm. Meanwhile, a second dragon is pursuing another one of the Dragonriders.
dg_dr_stg2_pg3_opt1=Get everyone out of there
dg_dr_stg2_pg3_opt2=Take off, leaving everybody to their fate (leave)
dg_dr_stg2_pg-abandon_para1=The ship takes off with a roar at your touch. Between the cries of the dragons, the sound of the engines, and the air rushing past, you can barely hear the fear and betrayal in the voices of the men you've left behind.
dg_dr_stg2_pg-abandon_opt1=Exit
dg_dr_stg2_pg4_para1=You turn on the external speakers. "WE ARE LEAVING," you blast to the survivors, "GET ON BOARD."
dg_dr_stg2_pg4_para2=The defeated Dragonriders need no further encouragement. They beeline for the hatch and you flicker the shield to let them on deck, where they collapse, wide-eyed and panting. Karengo isn't with them. You turn to ask about him, when a flicker of motion on a monitor catches your eye.
dg_dr_stg2_pg4_para3=Karengo is there, and he's riding a dragon, gripping the ridge of scales around its neck. The dragon is frantically trying to get him off, but deft application of his jetpack is, for now, keeping him on top of the beast. He lets out wild screams of triumph as they soar through the sky and at last you can understand the appeal of this whole expedition. Your admiration is cut short by two catastrophic crashes on either side of the ship and accompanying sirens. The dragons are trying to get through.
dg_dr_stg2_pg4_opt1=Take off (leave)
dg_dr_stg2_pg4_opt2=Swear and take off (leave)
dg_dr_stg2_pg4_opt2_para1="Pignuts," you mutter to yourself.
dg_dr_stg2_pg5_para1=The ship takes off quickly enough to make you light-headed. "Get on board!" shouts one of the men over the external speakers as you position the ship just below Karengo and lower the shields. Scales bounce off the roof like diamonds. Karengo releases his grip on the dragon and free falls toward you, slowing at the last possible moment before dropping through the top hatch. You flick on the shields and hit the engines, hard. They respond enthusiastically, rocketing you away from the mountain${ifColonized}. From the cabin comes the sound of back-slapping and, surprisingly, a sob.
dg_dr_stg2_pg5_para1_ifColonized=\ and into the safety of patrolled airspace
dg_dr_stg2_pg5_opt1=Take the men back home
#
#### Stage 3: Back Home ####
dg_dr_stg3_pg1_para1=As you land and fuel up, Karengo herds the seven surviving men out of the ship. "Meet us at the bar, yeah?" he says to you. "This day deserves a celebration." You nod, but can't help but notice red eyes and wet cheeks among the rest of the Dragonriders as they shuffle off.
dg_dr_stg3_pg1_opt1=Continue
dg_dr_stg3_pg2_para1=Later that day, you spot the Dragonriders at a corner table of the bar. The men, with the exception of Karengo, appear subdued.
dg_dr_stg3_pg2_para2="How goes it, ${playerLastName}?" he asks. "We were just raising a glass to mission success - made possible by you, of course. Great flying, brother." The bartender arrives with a round of drinks and Karengo raises one. "To the Dragonriders!" he says.
dg_dr_stg3_pg2_opt1="To the Dragonriders!"
dg_dr_stg3_pg2_opt2="To our fallen friends!"
dg_dr_stg3_pg2_opt2_para1=Karengo gives you an unreadable look and lowers his glass.
dg_dr_stg3_pg2_opt3="I'm good, thanks."
dg_dr_stg3_pg2_opt3_para1=Karengo gives you an unreadable look and lowers his glass.
dg_dr_stg3_pg3_para1="Your payment, plus Bolek and Jarek's signup fees. ==${rewardCredits}==."
dg_dr_stg3_pg3_opt1="Thanks."
dg_dr_stg3_pg3_opt2="I can't accept their money. It's not right."
dg_dr_stg3_pg3_opt2_para1=Karengo shrugs and doesn't take it back.
dg_dr_stg3_pg4_para1="Maybe I'll see you again sometime, yeah? I'm in need of a pilot with some guts." He nods in your direction, clearly dismissing you.
dg_dr_stg3_pg4_para1_opt1=Leave

dg_de_intel_desc_stg1=The adventurer Karengo and five others are traveling with you to ==${depthsPlanet}== in the ==${depthsSystem}==. He mentioned going underwater and something about a "quoijuu".
dg_de_intel_desc_stg2=Return to ==${depthsSourcePlanet}== in the ==${depthsSourceSystem}==.
dg_de_intel_desc_stg3=You found a crashed Gate Hauler deep in the oceans of ${depthsPlanet} and salvaged it as best you could.
#
#### Stage 1: Bar Event ####
dg_de_stg1_prompt=A boisterous laugh sounds from somewhere behind you. You haven't heard that voice since your ship was attacked by dragons.
dg_de_stg1_startBarEvent=Look around for Karengo
dg_de_stg1_pg1_para1="${playerFirstName}!" A huge hand claps you on the shoulder and spins you around, where you find yourself facing a large, widely grinning man.
dg_de_stg1_pg1_para2="Remember me? Yer the best pilot I've had - that stunt to get us out of ${dragonPlanet}, right out of the dragon's nest? Epic."
dg_de_stg1_pg1_para3=A crude, but professional, sign behind him reads, 'Dangerous Games - Karengo's Galactic Adventures'.
dg_de_stg1_pg1_para4="Like it?" Karengo follows your gaze. "Decided to make this an official thing. Well...an unofficial official thing.\nFeds wouldn't understand. Doesn't matter; I need a pilot again, and a good one. You've got a waterproof lander, right?"
dg_de_stg1_pg1_opt1="Uh, yeah. I think so."
dg_de_stg1_pg1_opt2="Of course."
dg_de_stg1_pg1_opt3="Sorry, mate. You'll have to find another pilot."
dg_de_stg1_pg2_para1=Karengo laughs. "It handles the vacuum of space, yeah? Yer right, it'll be fine. I've got a group of lads and ladies here rarin' to see some quoijuu in heat, right up close'n'personal. They've all got their own subpods, so how's about we load up and head out in the next few hours. Good? Good."
dg_de_stg1_pg2_para2="Oh, nearly forgot. We're headed to ==${depthsPlanet}==, in the ==${depthsSystem}==. Ain't sure who's in charge over there these days, so we might need to grease some palms. Best to keep your eyes open and shields up."
dg_de_stg1_pg2_opt1="We leave at noon!"
#
#### Stage 2: Arrival ####
dg_de_stg2_pg1_para1=As before, on ${dragonPlanet}, Karengo guides you down to a landing spot far away from the local government${ifPlayerOwnedWorld}. "Don't want no interruptions," he says.
dg_de_stg2_pg1_para1_ifPlayerOwnedWorld=, despite your assurances that you control the local government
dg_de_stg2_pg1_para2=Despite days of pressuring, you've been unable to get Karengo to tell you exactly what a quoijuu is, other than the slightly ominous, "the biggest fish". He sends a file to your ship computer and grins. "Since it's too late to back out now, it's time to fill you in. Quoijuu aren't the only thing down there; you've also got scyllae, taniwhales, morgawrii, plus some hydrothermal vents, none of which will benefit us if we run into them.
dg_de_stg2_pg1_para3=The good news is that there is a path to follow. The bad news is that the only person to make the path public was a bit of a nut. It's all in riddles, and I haven't been able to make head nor tail of them. Look them over and we'll follow your lead. And don't worry too much about it - what's the worst that could happen?"
dg_de_stg2_pg1_opt1="Ok, I'll take a look"
dg_de_stg2_pg1_opt2="We could get lost and then die"
dg_de_stg2_pg1_opt2_onSelected=Karengo smiles in a way that is only reminiscent of reassuring.
dg_de_stg2_pg2_para1=The adventure seekers, who you've spent the trip getting to know, are getting ready. You watch a nearby pair, Daciana and Mussie, helping each other out to put on wetsuits, when Daciana catches your gaze and grins. "Bafta, mate. Safe sailing, see you on the other side." Karengo gives you a signal and you hurry back to the cockpit to fly out, away from safe shoals and over the watery abyss.
dg_de_stg2_pg2_para2=At your touch, the ship slowly sinks below the waves. As Karengo warned you about on the way over, most of your navigation systems quickly flash red warnings and go offline; there is some unknown interference that overwhelm your poor ship's sensors, which were designed for space first and water second, or fifth, or not at all. Minutes tick by as the crew silently watches one of the few sensors still working. A young couple, Balazs and Jorma, uneasily exchange glances.
dg_de_stg2_pg2_opt1=Continue
dg_de_stg2_pg3_para1=EIGHT KILOMETERS, the depth meter reads.
dg_de_stg2_pg3_para1_2=TEN KILOMETERS.
dg_de_stg2_pg3_para1_3=SIXTEEN KILOMETERS. A loud, metallic creak echoes through the ship and Mussie jumps, startled.
dg_de_stg2_pg3_para2=Karengo claps him on the back and gives him a signature grin. "Maybe ${playerFirstName} can keep you aboard after this in case ${playerPronounHeShe} needs anything from a high shelf!" Mussie smiles weakly, but his eyes don't leave the readout.
dg_de_stg2_pg3_opt1=Continue
dg_de_stg2_pg4_para1=TWENTY-FIVE KILOMETERS. "This's it," Karengo announces, "Sub up! Let's see what there is to see. And ${playerFirstName}, keep it to passive sensors. Don't want to attract any undue attention." The ship smoothly descends into the mouth of a massive cave and your visibility, clouded by dark sulfide emissions from the hydrothermal vents at the floor, drops to less than eight meters. A fan of 10 personal subpods fan out behind you, their communication equipment syncing with yours to display them as blips on your screen.
dg_de_stg2_pg4_para2="Ok, ${playerFirstName}," Karengo crackles over the radio. "Lead on."

##### Riddle 1 #####
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_para1===No other path may you take\nOiled skins flash and flicker\nRazer spikes grow from the deep\nTitanic walls crush and smash\nHeed the beginnings to live.==
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_optEast=Go East
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_optNorth=Go North
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_optSouth=Go South
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_optWest=Go West
#
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_east_para1=Small schools of fish flit past as you guide your small fleet to the east. Out of the darkness, some sort of small whale crashes into your ship, setting off a couple of proximity alarms but causing no damage. It isn't until you hear screaming, distorted by the speakers, that it becomes clear what you just saw; the "small whale" was a just a flipper of something much, much larger.
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_east_para2="Morgawrii!" shouts Karengo, "Turn around! Turn around!"
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_east_opt1=Turn around
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_east_opt1_onSelected=Hauling on the controls, you spin your ship around. Leviathan shapes rise from below, stirring the water around your ship as it speeds to safety.
#
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_south_para1=Small schools of fish flit past as you guide your small fleet to the south. The swirling clouds of emissions seem to get thicker and thicker, until there's no reason to look at anything but the ship compass. The screen beeps once and a blip disappears.
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_south_para2="Elias?" Karengo asks. "Your transmitter just cut out." When there's no response, he swears. "Everybody go back." he broadcasts. "Something's wrong."
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_south_opt1=Go back
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_south_opt1_onSelected=You spin your ship around and hear a loud crunch come from outside - your shields have just impacted something large and solid. The outer lights shine off falling stone and it suddenly it all comes together; you've led everybody through a field of hydrothermal vents that rise for tens of meters off the bottom, obscured by their own noxious clouds. You guide your ship back to safety, toppling more underwater smokestacks as you go.
#
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_west_para1=Small schools of fish flit past as you guide your small fleet to the west. Minutes pass with no sign of danger, and finally Karengo broadcasts, "Good work, ${playerFirstName}. Looks like this is the way forward."
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_west_para2="Last one there's a rotten fish eye!" shouts Elias, and your screen shows his subpod leap forward and gain on you, followed quickly by others'.
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_west_para3=Then, without warning, a proximity sensor goes off at the same time your outer lights show a wall directly in front, stretching for as far as you can see. "Stop!" shouts Karengo, "It's the end of the cavern! Stop and go back!"
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_west_opt1=Go back
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_west_opt1_onSelected=Shuttering, your ship comes to a halt mere meters from the endless stone face. With a sinking feeling that has nothing to do with the depth, you turn the ship around and head back the way you came.
#
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_failure_para1=A quick roll call shows two subpods missing; Elias and Taddese never made it back.
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_failure_para2=A voice crackles over the radio, "It's clear up north!" Somebody, no doubt unimpressed by your navigating, has scouted ahead and found a way though.
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_failure_opt1=Open the next riddle
#
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_north_para1=You turn the ship to the north and glide it through the abyssal depths. The subpods race forward, each vying to outdo the other, seemingly heedless of the dangers that Karengo hinted at. With bated breath, you watch the sensors until at last the comms flare.
dg_de_stg2_riddle1_north_para2="Woah!" comes Karengo's voice. "I think that's far enough. Which way to we go next, ${playerFirstName}?"

##### Riddle 2 #####
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_para1===There are stingers in the deep\nA certain death, a dreamless sleep.\nGo to beast that has no bee\nNo danger there, just open sea.==
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_optEast=Go East
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_optNorth=Go North
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_optWest=Go West
#
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_north_para1=Bubbles rush past the thick windows as the group's subpods scout to the north at your direction. At first, all is quiet. Just as you start to exhale a sigh of relief, twin lightning bolts arc across the waterscape ahead and the ship sensors overload, blinded by an apparent release of electricity. The systems recover, showing subpods returning quickly back to the ship.
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_north_para2=One is missing; Mussie.
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_north_opt1=Go back
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_north_opt1_onSelected=You turn the ship back the way you came and pull up the sensor recording to see what happened. The flash of light came from viney seaweed, stretching as far up and down as the ship can detect. Evidently, contact with it released a jolt of electricity that lit up both the vine and Mussie's subpod.
#
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_west_1stWallCrash_para1=Small schools of fish flit past as you guide your small fleet to the west. Minutes pass with no sign of danger, and finally Karengo broadcasts, "Good work, ${playerFirstName}. Looks like this is the way forward."
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_west_1stWallCrash_para2="Last one there's a rotten fish eye!" shouts Mussie, and your screen shows his subpod leap forward and gain on you, followed quickly by others'.
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_west_1stWallCrash_para3=Then, without warning, a proximity sensor goes off at the same time your outer lights show a wall directly in front, stretching for as far as you can see. "Stop!" shouts Karengo, "It's the end of the cavern! Stop and go back!"
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_west_1stWallCrash_opt1=Go back
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_west_1stWallCrash_opt1_onSelected=Shuttering, your ship comes to a halt mere meters from the endless stone face. With a sinking feeling that has nothing to do with the depth, you turn the ship around and head back the way you came.
#
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_west_2ndWallCrash_para1=No no no...not again. The proximity alarm wails and this time, you're much quicker to stop the ship...but Mussie isn't so lucky. His subpod smashes straight into a different stretch of the same rock wall that claimed Elias and Taddese not minutes before.
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_west_2ndWallCrash_opt1=Go back
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_west_2ndWallCrash_opt1_onSelected=Again, you put the ship into reverse and turn around. This is not going at all how it was supposed to.
#
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_failure_firstFail_para1=Karengo sounds a roll call over the radio. Mussie never reports in, and his subpod beacon isn't responding. "Ah, well." says Karengo, without much sympathy. "You all stay here and I'll scout ahead."
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_failure_firstFail_para2=Only minutes later, he's found a clear path east, and you morosly trail the ship behind.
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_failure_secondFail_para1=Karengo sounds a roll call over the radio. Elias and Taddese are still missing, and now Mussie has failed to report in as well. None of their subpod beacons are responding.
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_failure_secondFail_para2="Ah, well." says Karengo, without much sympathy. "You all stay here and I'll scout ahead." Only minutes later, he's found a clear path east, and you morosly trail the ship behind.

#
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_east_firstSuccess_para1=Cautiously, you turn to the east and power forward. Subpods fly ahead, exulting in their agility in the face of the dangerous ocean.
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_east_firstSuccess_para2=After holding your breath for what feels like hours, Karengo radios you. "Knew you'd find your way eventually. What's the next direction?"
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_east_firstSuccess_opt1=Open the next riddle
#
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_east_secondSuccess_para1="A bee-less beast," you mutter to yourself. "A poet, this writer was not." Turning east, the ship powers forward, cautious but confident.
dg_de_stg2_riddle2_east_secondSuccess_para2=Subpods fly ahead, exulting in their agility in the face of the dangerous ocean. It isn't long until Karengo again radios you. "Knew I chose ya for a reason. What's the next direction?"

##### Riddle 3 #####
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_para1===To the north and to the east\nTrack my movements like a beast.\nA quick turn right and forward on,\nCome toward me where danger's gone.==
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_optNorth=Go North
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_optEast=Go East
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_optSouth=Go South
#
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_north_quoijuu_para1_firstFail=Buoyed by your navigation thus far, you make the call to go north, completing the zig-zag pattern.
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_north_quoijuu_para1_secondFail=Hesitantly, you make the call to go north, completing the zig-zag pattern.
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_north_quoijuu_para1_thirdFail=Disheartened at this point, you make the call to go north, completing the zig-zag pattern.
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_north_quoijuu_para2=Subpods, as usual, race ahead of the ship, despite all logic. "Wall to the east!" calls out Daciana, whose beacon on the ship display starts to move north-west, presumably avoiding the undersea hazard, and joining up with Jorma. "Hmm," radios in Karengo. "We should be right about on top of it. Send out a ping." It's almost a relief to send out a pulse to map the surroundings after flying dark for so long.
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_north_quoijuu_para3=The result, however, is a surprise. The display maps two leviathan-sized *things* ahead, each over 200 meters long. Dozens of sets of flippers run along each 80-meter-tall side and hundreds of human-sized teeth line their jaws.
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_north_quoijuu_para4=You goggle at the display for a moment, taking it in, and draw breath to call out the alarm when an eye appears through the ship window, yellow, glowing, alien, and massive. All at once, you turn and accelerate, shouting the alarm to any who hadn't already realized, and hoping that you're leaving the leviathan beasts behind. A quick glance at the display shows at least one subpod following behind; good enough. If one of those rams the ship, nobody is going home anyway.
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_north_quoijuu_para5=It's a long while before you slow and turn around. No mammoth sea monster comes out of the darkness, and you take a breath.
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_north_quoijuu_para6="Quoijuu," says Karengo simply.
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_north_quoijuu_opt1=Continue
#
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_east_wall_firstWallFail_para1=Small schools of fish flit past as you guide your small fleet to the east. Minutes pass with no sign of danger, and finally Karengo broadcasts, "Good work, ${playerFirstName}. Looks like this is the way forward."
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_east_wall_firstWallFail_para2="Last one there's a rotten fish eye!" shouts Jorma, and your screen shows his subpod leap forward and gain on you, followed quickly by others'.
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_east_wall_firstWallFail_para3=Then, without warning, a proximity sensor goes off at the same time your outer lights show a wall directly in front, stretching for as far as you can see. "Stop!" shouts Karengo, "It's the end of the cavern! Stop and go back!"
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_east_wall_firstWallFail_opt1=Go back
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_east_wall_firstWallFail_opt1_onSelected=Shuttering, your ship comes to a halt mere meters from the endless stone face. With a sinking feeling that has nothing to do with the depth, you turn the ship around and head back the way you came.
#
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_east_wall_secondWallFail_para1=No no no...not again. The proximity alarm wails and this time, you're much quicker to stop the ship...but your tracker shows two subpods smash straight into the stone wall looming in front of you.
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_east_wall_secondWallFail_opt1=Go back
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_east_wall_secondWallFail_opt1_onSelected=Again, you put the ship into reverse and turn around. This is not going at all how it was supposed to.
#
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_east_wall_thirdWallFail_para1=By now, the proximity alarm is familiar to you, as is the solid wall rushing toward your already-slowing ship and the feeling as the ship's subpod tracker loses two more dots, leaving a single remaining subpod; Karengo's.
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_east_wall_thirdWallFail_opt1=Go back
#
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_failure_para1=Jorma and Daciana never report back in.
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_failure_para2="You stay." radios Karengo. He sounds frustrated for the first time, and you keep the ship in place, watching his subpod dot radiate outwards, exploring.
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_failure_para3="Come here." he finally says. His dot has stopped moving, hovering to the south, and you turn to follow, wondering if this misadventure is finally over.
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_failure_para4="It's here," radios Karengo. "Fire off a ping." You comply, and the display shows a massive object directly below you.
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_failure_opt1=Continue
#
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_south_success_para1=You smoothly turn the ship to the right, heading south.
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_south_success_para2="Should be close," radios Karengo. "Fire off a ping." It's almost a relief to send out a pulse to map the surroundings after flying dark for so long.
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_south_success_para3=The result, however, is a surprise. The display shows a massive object directly below you...as well as as two leviathan-sized *things* back the way you came, each over 200 meters long. Dozens of sets of flippers run along each 80-meter-tall side and hundreds of human-sized teeth line their jaws.
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_south_success_para4=You goggle at the display for a moment, holding your breath, but the leviathans seem uninterested. You shudder, imagining what one of those could do if you'd turned the wrong way, before your interest returns to the mysterious bulk resting below the ship.
dg_de_stg2_riddle3_south_success_opt1=Continue
#
dg_de_stg2_viewTreasure_para1=A 3D holo floats on the console, displaying the smooth lines of a starship soaring down into the depths. The jagged edges suggest that this is only a part of a much larger vessel, although it's hard to guess at the size of the whole ship from the fragment.
dg_de_stg2_viewTreasure_para2=Your craft moves closer to investigate and you send out another ping, this time more focused, and the holographic ship display flickers and refines. The outlines of sealed entrances are visible, unnecessary with the ship torn apart as it is. Sea growth is mostly absent from the hull, to your surprise, except for a radial pattern of some sort of crystal-shaped growth. Infrared imaging shows a dim glow of heat at its center.
dg_de_stg2_viewTreasure_para3_ifOthersSurvived="What we have here, folks," breaks in Karengo, "is a Gate Hauler. A chunk'o'one, anyway. And we're gonna take whatever we want. Let's see what there is to see."
dg_de_stg2_viewTreasure_para3_ifOnlyPlayerSurvived="What we have here, ${playerFirstName}," breaks in Karengo, "is a Gate Hauler. A chunk'o'one, anyway. And we're gonna take whatever we want. Let's see what there is to see."
dg_de_stg2_viewTreasure_para4=Now that active communication is low-risk, you bring up the video feed from Karengo's subpod as he floats toward the heat source. Bathed in floodlight, you can see that there are actual crystals formed on the ship hull, glowing a dull red.
dg_de_stg2_viewTreasure_para5_ifOthersSurvived=An unknowable something has rent a hole near the crystalline spiral, and Karengo disappears inside. The rest of the subpods wait outside, apparently spooked. "Jackpot!" comes his voice. "There's an AI core in here! ${playerFirstName}, get closer and let's get this out."
dg_de_stg2_viewTreasure_para5_ifOnlyPlayerSurvived=An unknowable something has rent a hole near the crystalline spiral, and Karengo disappears inside. "Jackpot!" comes his voice. "There's an AI core in here! ${playerFirstName}, get closer and let's get this out."
dg_de_stg2_viewTreasure_para6_ifAllOthersSurvived=It's slow work, but the group is able to cut loose the ==Beta Core==, along with as much other salvage as possible. The crystalline growth covers everything inside the ship, making extraction difficult, but many hands make light work and you end up with a sizable haul. At last, you are done.
dg_de_stg2_viewTreasure_para6_ifSomeOthersSurvived=It's slow work, but the remains of the group are able to cut loose the ==Beta Core==, along with as much other salvage as possible. The crystalline growth covers everything inside the ship, making extraction difficult, but many hands make light work and you end up with an acceptable haul. At last, you are done.
dg_de_stg2_viewTreasure_para6_ifOnlyPlayerSurvived=It's slow work, but you and Karengo are able to cut loose the Beta Core<, along with as much other salvage as possible. The crystalline growth covers everything inside the ship, making extraction difficult. You wish there were others to help gather more salvage, but, at last, you are done.
dg_de_stg2_viewTreasure_opt1=Return to the surface
#
dg_de_stg2_backAtSurface_para1=Carefully, you navigate back to the surface, the knowledge that you've made it through once doing absolutely nothing to help with the very rational fear of the depths. Walls seem to loom just out of sight, and massive, yellow eyes seem to appear, then dissolve into tricks of the light.
dg_de_stg2_backAtSurface_para2_ifOthersSurvived=It seems ages, but finally you break through to the surface. Karengo smiles, and a sigh of relief goes through the crew.
dg_de_stg2_backAtSurface_para2_ifOnlyPlayerSurvived=It seems ages, but finally you break through to the surface. Karengo smiles, but only you and he are left to be relieved.
dg_de_stg2_backAtSurface_para3="Alright," he says. "Let's get back to ==${depthsSourcePlanet}== in the ==${depthsSourceSystem}==. ${playerFirstName}, kindly be our chariot and haul."
dg_de_stg2_backAtSurface_opt1=Leave

#### Stage 3: Return ####
dg_de_stg3_backToStart_pg1_para1=The crystal-infected Beta Core has been thoroughly inspected since being salvaged from the watery depths of ${depthsPlanet}.
dg_de_stg3_backToStart_pg1_para2_ifGatesAwakenedMidQuestNotDone=The storage units of the Core were almost entirely corrupted. The only decipherable information was related to Gate Codes, but didn't provide enough context to understand.
dg_de_stg3_backToStart_pg1_para2_ifFailedSomeRiddles=The storage units of the Core were almost entirely corrupted, but your fleet engineers were able to extract ==one gate code==.
dg_de_stg3_backToStart_pg1_para2_ifFailedNoRiddles=The storage units of the Core were almost entirely corrupted, but between your fleet engineers and the members of Karengo's crew, who, as adventurous people, had some amount of experience with Domain tech, ==two gate codes== were extracted.
dg_de_stg3_backToStart_pg1_para3=The crystals themselves are unlike anything anyone has seen before, but through somewhat questionable trial and error (although he insists it's genius), Karengo discovers that, when heated, they amplify the effect of the many recreational drugs he has on his person.
dg_de_stg3_backToStart_pg1_para4=However, they've proven to only grow near a power source that has been submerged in water from ${depthsPlanet}. Efforts to stimulate growth through other means have all failed.
dg_de_stg3_backToStart_pg1_para5===If cultivated, they could significantly boost the effective production of drugs back on ${depthsPlanet}.==
dg_de_stg3_backToStart_pg1_para6=Before disappearing into the crowd, Karengo paid you ==${depthsCreditReward}==.
