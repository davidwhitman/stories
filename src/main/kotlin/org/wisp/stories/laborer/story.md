A young man in laborer's clothing is arguing with a woman in a flight suit.

Go see what the laborer is arguing about

"Lady, I'm not trying to low-ball you here!" the man is nearly shouting. "I don't have the money! That's the whole point!"

"I appreciate your conundrum, " says the woman in a clipped voice. "However, my policy is cash upfront. Good day."

She turns and walks away, briskly, and the man slumps against the bar.

- What was that all about?

He gives you a once-over, and his eyes regain a spark of hope. "You're a captain? Please, I need to get to ||${laborerDestPlanet}|| in the ||${laborerDestSystem}||. Work has dried up here, and I need a fresh start."

- "And what's your offer?"
- "Work dried up on whole planet?"
  - ""

His eyes drop. "See, that's the thing. I can pay you after I earn the money. I've just gotta get to ${laborerDestPlanet} to get work, and then I'll send the money."
